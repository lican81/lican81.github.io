Using such systems to multiply an analogue-voltage-amplitude-vector by an analogue-conductance-matrix at a reasonably large scale has, however, proved challenging due to difficulties in device engineering and array integration. Here we show that reconfigurable memristor crossbars composed of hafnium oxide memristors on top of metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors are capable of analogue vector-matrix multiplication with array sizes of up to 128× 64 cells. Our output precision (5–8 bits, depending on the array size) is the result of high device yield (99.8%) and the multilevel, stable states of the memristors, while the linear device current–voltage characteristics and low wire resistance …'}\n",

However, in situ learning on a large-scale multiple-layer memristor network has yet to be demonstrated because of challenges in device property engineering and circuit integration. Here we monolithically integrate hafnium oxide-based memristors with a foundry-made transistor array into a multiple-layer neural network. We experimentally demonstrate in situ learning capability and achieve competitive classification accuracy on a standard machine learning dataset, which further confirms that the training algorithm allows the network to adapt to hardware imperfections. Our simulation using the experimental parameters suggests that a larger network would further increase the classification accuracy. The memristor neural network is a promising hardware platform for artificial intelligence with high speed-energy efficiency.'}\n",

Here we show that a diffusive memristor based on silver nanoparticles in a dielectric film can be used to create an artificial neuron with stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics and tunable integration time, which is determined by silver migration alone or its interaction with circuit capacitance. We integrate these neurons with nonvolatile memristive synapses to build fully memristive artificial neural networks.

In this study, a neuromorphic vision sensor to encode the changes of fluorescence intensity into spikes in the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements is adopted, closely resembling the operation of the human vision system, which leads to highly compressed data volume and reduced latency. It also results in a vast dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and exceptional signal‐to‐background ratio. After a thorough theoretical evaluation, the experiment with an off‐the‐shelf event camera demonstrated a 13× …'}\n",

Yet in practice, despite their theoretical advantages, the body of work on event-based multi-object tracking (MOT) remains in its infancy, especially in real-world settings where events from complex background and camera motion can easily obscure the true target motion. In this work, an event-based multi-object tracker, called SpikeMOT, is presented to address these challenges. SpikeMOT leverages spiking neural networks to extract sparse spatiotemporal features from event streams associated with objects. The resulting spike train representations are used to track the object movement at high frequency, while a simultaneous object detector provides updated spatial information of these objects at an equivalent frame rate. To evaluate the effectiveness of SpikeMOT, we introduce DSEC-MOT, the first large-scale event-based MOT benchmark incorporating fine-grained annotations for objects experiencing severe occlusions, frequent trajectory intersections, and long-term re-identification in real-world contexts. Extensive experiments employing DSEC-MOT and another event-based dataset, named FE240hz, demonstrate SpikeMOT's capability to achieve high tracking accuracy amidst challenging real-world scenarios, advancing the state-of-the-art in event-based multi-object tracking.\"}\n",

We propose and demonstrate a circuit architecture and programming protocol that converts the analog computing result to digital at the last step and enables low-precision analog devices to perform high-precision computing. We use a weighted sum of multiple devices to represent one number, in which subsequently programmed devices are used to compensate for preceding programming errors.

This work proposes and experimentally demonstrates an algorithm-hardware co-designed GAT that runs efficiently and reliably in ReRAM-based hardware. The neighborhood information is retrieved from trained node embeddings stored on crossbars in a single time step, and attention is implemented by efficient hashing and hamming similarity for higher robustness. Our scaled simulation based on the experimentally-validated model shows only 0.9% accuracy loss with over 35,500x energy improvement on the Cora dataset compared with GPU, and 1.1% accuracy improvement with 2× energy improvement compared with state-of-the-art ReRAM-based GNN accelerator.'}"
