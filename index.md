Welcome to the **C**ognitive and **A**daptive **N**euromorphic computing Lab (CANLab) at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk)!  

**We currently have multiple openings (Research Postgraduate (Ph.D., MPhil.). Students, Research Assistant, Postdoc).** If you are interested in joining us, please feel free to email me at [canl@hku.hk](mailto:canl@hku.hk).
Our research will expand from **micro/nanofabrication for emerging devices, prototype chip design/ tape-out/measurement, to hardware-algorithm co-optimization** for novel applications including **A.I./machine learning**. Please refer to the [Research](/research.html) page for more details.
