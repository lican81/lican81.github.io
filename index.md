My name is **Can Li** (Chinese: 李灿), and I am currently an assistant professor at Department of Electric and Electronic Engineering (EEE) of **the University of Hong Kong (HKU)**, working on analog and neuromorphic computing accelerators based on post-CMOS emerging devices (e.g. memristors), for efficient machine/deep learning, network security, signal processing, etc. Before that, I spent two years at Hewlett Packard Labs in Palo Alto, California, and obtained my Ph.D. from University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and B.S./M.S. from Peking University.

**We currently have multiple openings (Research Postgraduate (Ph.D., MPhil.). Students, Research Assistant, Postdoc).** If you are interested in joining us, please feel free to email me at [canl@hku.hk](mailto:canl@hku.hk).
Our research will expand from **micro/nanofabrication for emerging devices, prototype chip design/ tape-out/measurement, to hardware-algorithm co-optimization** for novel applications including **A.I./machine learning**. Please refer to the [Research](/research.html) page for more details.

**A**ccelerating
**N**euromorphic applications
(**CAN**) Group,  -->
