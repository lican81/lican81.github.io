<p>My name is Can Li, and this is my personal website. I'am currently a Ph.D. student working on memristor based analog and 
    neuromorphic computing accelerator. 

<p>I was born and raised in a central part of China, and later I went to college in Beijing. During college, I tried to start an internet company. Although got invested by venture captial, we ended up with failure, just like most of the start-ups did.

<p>From the expereience, I learnt myself to be a man of science instead of entrepreneur. I decided to pursue Ph.D., and started the 
    research about memristor in Massachusetts, USA. At the beginning of my doctoral research, I focused on material engineering to 
    optimize memristor performance. After that, we collaborated with Hewllet Packard Labs to integrate our device on an integrated 
    circuit chip and built the world-largest working memristors array. We demonstrated the memristor accelerator (Dot-Product Engine, DPE) 
    can be used for signal/image processing and neural networks. To date, I have published 10 journal papers (8 of them on journals with 
    IF>10, 4 of them as 1st author), 23 conference papers (9 of them as 1st author), 1 book chapter, 2 granted patents, and more papers 
    submitted or under peer review.
