<p>My name is Can Li, and this is my personal website. I'am currently a Ph.D. student and I am working on memristor based analog and 
    neuromorphic computing accelerator. </p>

<p>I was born and raised in a central part of China, and later I went to <em>Peking University (PKU)</em> in Beijing. During college, I tried to start
     an internet company. Although got invested by venture captial, we ended up with failure, just like most of the start-ups did.
</p>

<p>From the expereience, I learnt that I am a man of science instead of a entrepreneur. I decided to pursue Ph.D., and started  
    research about memristor at <em>University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass)</em> in USA. In the beginning of my doctoral research, I focused on material engineering to 
    optimize memristor performance. After that, we integrated our device on an integrated 
    circuit chip and built the world-largest working memristors array. Collaborating with <em>Hewllet Packard Labs (HPE labs)</em>, we demonstrated the memristor accelerator is effective and efficient in signal/image processing and neural networks. To date, I have published 12 journal papers (9 of them on journals with 
    IF>10, 5 of them as 1st author), 26 conference papers (12 of them as 1st author), 1 book chapter, 2 granted patents, and more papers submitted or under peer review.
